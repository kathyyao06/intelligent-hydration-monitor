# Intelligent Hydration Monitor

This project involves building an Arduino-based hydration monitor that utilizes capacitive touch to detect when your lips touch a tube, automatically dispensing water into your mouth. An OLED monitor tracks the amount of water dispensed, helping you achieve your hydration goals. The final wearable device features a laser-cut enclosure, a 3D-printed wrist strap, and a soldered protoboard.
